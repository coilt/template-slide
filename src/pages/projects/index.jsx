            Workflow Complexity: Using multiple branches within a single
            repository can introduce complexity, especially if the projects are
            significantly different from each other. Managing separate
            repositories might offer a cleaner workflow, especially if you need
            to enforce different release cycles or permissions for each project.
            Branch Management: If you opt for a single repository with multiple
            branches, ensure that you have a clear branching strategy to avoid
            confusion and conflicts. You might consider using branch naming
            conventions or organizing branches based on the projects they
            represent. In summary, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the
            decision depends on your specific requirements and preferences.
            Evaluate factors such as project dependencies, collaboration needs,
            and workflow complexity to determine whether separate repositories
            or a single repository with multiple branches is more suitable for
            your testing projects.
