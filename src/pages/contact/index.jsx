          Let me go, you don't understand what will happen. My brothers-" The
          Lord Cleric punched her. Her head flew back and a spray of blood wet
          the dry mud and spattered over the leaves concealing me. Face wet with
          tears and whimpering, she tried to crawl toward the trees and dragged
          up clumps of earth with her fingernails. "You must let me go." The
          words sounded muffled, like she had a mouthful of something foul. The
          Lord Cleric executed a neat half turn and stamped on her thigh. There
          was a sharp snap, like I'd picked up a twig and yanked on the ends
          until the fibers split apart and cracked open. The fairy's leg buckled
          into an unnatural shape and she screamed. The sound was guttural, a
          direct translation of pain to sound. I slapped a hand over my mouth to
          smother my own shriek. Not because of the broken bone, I'd seen and
          heard tons of those, but because I'd caught the Lord Clerics profile
          and recognized the handsome face.
